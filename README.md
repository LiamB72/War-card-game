# War card game
 It's the classic war card game where two player have at first a deck of 26 cards from a 52 card game. Each player take a card from their deck  where the opponent can't see which card is taken, then both player place their card to see which of the two has the highest value, for the winner to take both cards back. The goal is to get all 52 cards. However, the twist is that it's made in python, using pyqt6 for the GUI and the socket module for the connect and data transfer between players. And as you may have understood, you are meant to play with at least to computers! Thus maximum and minimum of 2 players are required to play that game!
